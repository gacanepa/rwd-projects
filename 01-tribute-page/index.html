          <li><strong>1982</strong> - Receives a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam</li>
          <li><strong>Early 1990s</strong> - Creates Python</li>
          <li><strong>1995</strong> - Moves to the US</li>
          <li><strong>1999</strong> - Submits a funding proposal to DARPA called <em>Computer Programming for Everybody</em> with an outline of his goals for Python:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors</li>
            <li>Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development</li>
            <li>Code that is as understandable as plain English</li>
            <li>Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>2000-2003</strong> - Works at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope" target="_blank">Zope Corporation</a></li>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Typically when you ask a programmer to explain to a lay person what a programming language is, they will say that it is how you tell a computer what to do. But if that was all, why would they be so passionate about programming languages when they talk among themselves?</p>
        <p>In reality, programming languages are how programmers express and communicate ideas — and the audience for those ideas is other programmers, not computers. The reason: the computer can take care of itself, but programmers are always working with other programmers, and poorly communicated ideas can cause expensive flops. In fact, ideas expressed in a programming language also often reach the end users of the program — people who will never read or even know about the program, but who nevertheless are affected by it.</p>
        <p>Think of the incredible success of companies like Google or Facebook. At the core of these are ideas — ideas about what computers can do for people. To be effective, an idea must be expressed as a computer program, using a programming language. The language that is best to express an idea will give the team using that language a key advantage, because it gives the team members — people! — clarity about that idea.</p>
